Creating a user activity detection mechanism by useEffect() hook. 

1 : ADD VARIABLES STATE AND REF
2 : ADD EVENTS ARRAY , WE USE THIS TO TRIGGER OUR HOOK!
3 : ADD A USEEFFECT HOOK TO DETECT STATE CHANGES!
4 : CREATE THE EVENT HANDLER FOR EVENTS WITH OUR ACTIVITY TIMES!
5 : SET UP THE EVENT LISTENERS AND REMOVE THEM WHEN FINISHED
6 : RETURN THE ACTIVE VARIABLE

YOU CAN DETECT USER ACTITY/INACTIVITY TO RENDER EVENTS CONDITIONALLY!

I HAVE SET THE INACTIVE TIMER AFTER 1 SECOND
